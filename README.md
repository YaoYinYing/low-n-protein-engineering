# lowN_protein_engineering_of_PETase
Using a deep learning assisted in-silico directed evolution method inspired by low-N paper [cite here] to engineer a mutant PET degrading enzyme (isPETase) with improved thermal stability compared to wild-type. Input wild-type mutants will come from GRAPE paper (cite here), which will also serve as a benchmark for comparison of method success.
