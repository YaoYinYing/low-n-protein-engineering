# Low-N Protein Engineering of thermally stable PETase for ester-based plastic degradation

We apply the methods used in low-N protein engineering with data-efficient deep learning (Biswas et al), to do in-silico directed evolution on a wild type PETase (hydrolyzing enzyme) that can degrade ester-based plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ester-based polyurethanes (PU). This is done by deep learning assisted in-silico directed evolution (DE).

Input wild-type mutants will come from Computational redesign of a PETase for plastic biodegradation by the GRAPE strategy (Cui et al), who achieve a similar goal using greedy algorithms and k-means clustering. Their results will also serve as a benchmark to compare the success the low-N in-silico DE method.

We (hope to) show that the low-N, eUniRep method is applicable beyond just the 2 cases of proteins shown (avGFP and TEM-1 beta-lactamase) in the paper by applying the same methodology to a novel problem. Our goal is to engineer a new mutant PETase that will have greater thermal stability (melting temperature, Tm) than the wild-type we started with, while at least maintaining enzymatic activity.
